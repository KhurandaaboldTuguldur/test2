The owner of a shire horse has thanked firefighters and others who helped save her beloved animal from a ditch.

Bilbo, 14, was spooked during a ride in Southery, west Norfolk, and unseated his owner Caryn Wilkinson.

After running across a field, he was found almost upside down at the bottom of a bank. Local fire crews eventually managed to drag him out with the help of farm machinery.

Ms Wilkinson said Bilbo had since made a full recovery and she intended to hop back on the saddle soon. She said she had "just the most heartfelt gratitude" for those who helped.
