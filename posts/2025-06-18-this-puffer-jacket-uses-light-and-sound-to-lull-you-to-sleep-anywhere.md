Often described as one of the world’s most sleep-deprived nations, Japan repeatedly ranks last, or near last, in international surveys and studies on sleep duration and quality.

One design firm has developed a creative solution that it believes can give real power to naps.


Its “smart” puffer jacket concept is intended to optimize short naps by providing bespoke sound and lighting based on the user’s biometric data, such as heart rate and body temperature, which is gathered by a wearable ring.

“We realized that sleep is a very personal thing,” said Dai Miyata, creative art director of Konel, which developed the jacket in collaboration with the sleep technology division at NTT DX Partners, a digital consulting firm.

“You can’t force someone to sleep, they have to fall asleep on their own. So, we started thinking, is there something we can create that helps people ease into sleep on their own terms?”

The ZZZN sleep apparel is designed to be worn day-to-day as a normal jacket, albeit an oversized one, but users can also activate “sleep mode” by putting up the hood when they want a snooze on their commute home.


Not yet intended as a consumer product, a conceptual prototype of the invention will be on display from June 24 until July 7 at Expo 2025 Osaka, where visitors will be able to test it out for themselves. Miyata hopes that the innovation will make people “more curious about sleep,” and spark conversations about how to approach rest better.

“It’s such a familiar part of life, yet there’s still so much we don’t know about it,” he added.

‘A fusion of clothing and bedding’
Konel began developing the jacket last year with a grant from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, as part of a program to transform personal healthcare data into usable services and products.

“With Japan being one of the most sleep-deprived countries, we’ve been thinking about how to tackle this issue through business initiatives,” said Teppei Ogata, production manager for NTT DX Partners’ sleep technology division.

The company’s previous efforts didn’t lead to significant behavior changes, Ogata said: so instead, they decided to take a “fun and creative” approach coming up with the playful concept of “portable sleep.”

The jacket is based on “yogi,” a quilted kimono worn which was popular in the Edo period (1615–1868) for sleeping, particularly in winter. While yogi is often compared to pajamas, it’s “closer to something you could fall asleep in, and then just wake up and go,” said Miyata. “It’s more like a fusion of clothing and bedding.”

With a deep hood for privacy, the ZZZN jacket has an inbuilt system that converts the wearer’s biometric data into light and sound.

It uses red light to induce sleep, while blue light is intended to suppress melatonin to wake the body up. Minyata said the light pulses at rates that mimic slow breathing patterns, to promote deeper sleep, and are accompanied by “neuromusic” with frequencies that “act directly on brain waves to aid sleep.” Some preliminary studies have found that music or sounds of certain frequencies could improve sleep, although more research is needed.

The biometric ring continues to monitor the wearer’s stress as they doze off. “If the person’s stress level significantly decreases, the same light and sound are maintained, but if their stress doesn’t decrease much, the system switches to sounds that are even more effective at promoting sleep,” said Miyata.
